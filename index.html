        <p> My name is Hakob Muradyan, I was born in 11/05/1996 in Armenia, Yerevan. About 2.5 years ago I won a Green card lottery and moved to United States.
            When I was 14 I went to technology center college for 2 years and thats when the Love between me and Programming started. While studying in the University I have been
            a web programming tutor in the TUMO center for creative technologies.  
            Now I am going to UCLA Extension to pursue my dream of being a certificated Programmer. Hopefully UCLA will be a firm ground to start my path.
            My short-term goal is to reach a junior level in march 2020 and get a well-paid job which i will enjoy.
